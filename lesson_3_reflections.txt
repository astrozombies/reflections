When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you were collaborating with others, or want to share your code with others. Also if you were working from more than one machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Others may be working on the same branch, pulling changes would get confusing unless you were ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks take someone else's repository and clones it into your GitHub, making it clear where it was sourced from while allowing you to work on it independently. A clone takes a copy of the repository either locally or from a remote location. Branches represent a modification to the code in a new direction, keeping the original version of the code accessible and updateable.
